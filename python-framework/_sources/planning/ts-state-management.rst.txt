Type System State Management
============================

State classification
--------------------

.. note::

	This article could benefit from collapsable entries for the state classifications.


The state of an artifact can be classified into the following classes.

Constituent state
	Required constituent of the artifacts contents between atomic operations.

	.. rubric:: Requirements

	- Must be stored when artifact is stored
	- Must be loaded when artifact is loaded

	.. rubric:: Use cases

	- Define the artifact contents

Inter operational state
	Transient between atomic operations.

	.. rubric:: Requirements

	- Must be stored when suspending atomic operation
	- Must be loaded when resuming atomic operation

	.. rubric:: Use cases

	- Progress reporting
	- Suspending and resuming atomic operation
	- Internal use by artifact procedures

Derived state
	State that always can be recreated from other states as long as no circular dependency emerges.

	.. rubric:: Requirements

	- Must be dervied from other states
	- Must not be derived in a manner that creates a circular dependency

	.. rubric:: Use cases

	- Caching

Transient state
	State that is only valid in the current session.

	.. rubric:: Requirements

	- Must not be required outside of the session

	.. rubric:: Use cases

	- Synchronization
	- Memory management
