Planned sphinx extensions
=========================

.. warning::

	This document is in a very early state and should be considered a sketch that may have drastic changes made to it at any time.


Wishlist
--------

- Register git repositories and organizations with roles to create links to repositories.
	- Would be nice to copy various CLI commands directly from those or have other common operations available for the user of the web page.
- Custom image directive that gives more control over rendering, especially to avoid that the theme messes with images due to the light/dark theme feature
