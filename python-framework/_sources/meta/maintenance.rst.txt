	This document is in a very early state and should be considered a sketch that may have drastic changes made to it at any time.


Updating documentation
----------------------

.. rubric:: Prerequisites

- `python-framework-docs <https://github.com/efforting-tech/python-framework-docs>`_ is checked out to ``./docs``
- `python-framework-docs-rendered <https://github.com/efforting-tech/python-framework-docs-rendered>`_ is checked out to ``./docs-rendered``
- Current working directory is ``./docs``

.. rubric:: Procedure

Start by building the documentation and make sure everything is as it should.

.. code-block:: shell-session

	$ make html

Then synchronize the newly generated documentation.

.. code-block:: shell-session

	$ rsync -aP build/html/ ../docs-rendered/python-framework/

Go to the ``./docs-rendered`` directory, update the git branch and verify that the staging looks good.

.. code-block:: shell-session

	$ cd ../docs-rendered/
	$ git add -A
	$ git status

Once the staging is in order, commit and push to main.

.. code-block:: shell-session

	$ git commit -m "Updated documentation"
	ยง git push

Github.com will push the changes out and that may take a few minutes.

.. note::

	This process may change in the future to go via a pending branch but probably not. Instead this will probably be handled in the source end of the documentation rather than the rendered end.
